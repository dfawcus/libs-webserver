This is the initial release of the 'webserver' library (version 1.0.0)
Initial release is made at version 1.0.0 because this library is in fact
very well tested and was previously part of the SQLClient library.


Scope
====
This library provides a single main WebServer class which works with a
framework to support the use of loadable bundles to handle requests
on particular URLs.
The main of the library is to make it easy for you to write programs
which can act as web servers (eg. and XMLRPC server) or simply provide
a web-based user interface so that your application can be controlled
from a web browser.
Incoming requests may by handled by a delegate, or passed to a bundle
loaded at runtime on the basis of the URL requested.
Convenience methods are provided to vend static pages or vend template
pages where values provided by your code are inserted into the templates.
The class supports HTTPS on a unix-like platform, but only HTTP on windows.

Platforms

GNUstep gnu/linux

WebServer
The WebServer class provides the framework for a GNUstep program to act
as an HTTP or HTTPS server for simple applications.
It does not attempt to be a general-purpose web server, but is rather
intended to permit a program to easily handle requests from automated
systems which are intended to control, monitor, or use the services
provided by the program in which the class is embedded.
The emphasis is on making it robust/reliable/simple, so you can rapidly
develop software using it. It is a single-threaded, single-process
system using asynchronous I/O, so you can easily run it under debug
in gdb to fix any bugs in your delegate object.

The class is controlled by a few straightforward settings and basically
operates by handing over requests to its delegate. The delegate must at
least implement the [<WebServerDelegate>-processRequest:response:for:]
method.

 Built-in facilities include -

 * Parsing of parameter string in request URL
 * Parsing of url encoded form data in a POST request
 * Parsing of form encoded data in a POST request
 * Substitution into template pages on output
 * SSL support
 * HTTP Basic authentication
 * Limit access by IP address
 * Limit total number of simultaneous connections
 * Limit number of simultaneous connectionsform one address
 * Limit idle time permitted on a connection
 * Limit size of request headers permitted
 * Limit size of request body permitted

WebServerBundles

This is an example delegate for the WebServer class.
It is intended to act as a convenience for a scheme where the WebServer
instance in a program is configured by values obtained from the user
defaults system, and incoming requests may be handled by different
delegate objects depending on the path information supplied in the request.
The WebServerBundles intance is responsible for loading the bundles
(based on information in the WebServerBundles dictionary in the user defaults
system) and for forwarding requests to the appropriate bundles for processing.
If a request comes in which is not an exact match for the path of any handler,
the request path is repeatedly shortened by chopping off the last path
component until a matching handler is found.
The paths in the dictionary must not end with a slash... an empty string
will match all requests which do not match a handler with a longer path.
